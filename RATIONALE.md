# Rationale for a new distributed SQL engine

There are many excellent distributed SQL engines currently available on the market. Why do we need yet another one?

## True serverless architecture
Most distributed SQL engines are designed to be deployed on conventional containers (*e.g.* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances). PuffinDB is designed to run on serverless functions (*e.g.* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions)
