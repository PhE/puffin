Serverless [HTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_transactional/analytical_processing) data mesh platform powered by [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) × [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) × [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)

Accelerate DuckDB with 10,000 [AWS Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

**Kickoff meetup**: [Rovinj, Croatia, March 29-30, 2023](meetup)

## Introduction
If you are using DuckDB client-side with [any client application](docs/Clientless.md), adding the [PuffinDB extension](docs/Extension.md) will let you:
- Collaborate on the same [Iceberg tables](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) with other users
- Write back to an Iceberg table with [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) transactional integrity
- Accelerate and | or schedule the downloading of large tables to your client
- Execute [cross-database joins](docs/Query%20Proxy.md#query-delegation) (*Cf.* [Edge-Driven Data Integration](EDDI.md))
- Translate between 19 [SQL dialects](docs/Query%20Proxy.md#dialect-translation)
- Invoke [remote query generators](docs/Query%20Proxy.md)
- Invoke [curl](https://curl.se/) commands
- Log queries on your data lake

Furthermore, adding a single [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template to your [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account will let you:
- Distribute queries across tens of thousands of serverless functions and a [Monostore](docs/Monostore.md)
- Cache tables and run computations at the edge ([Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) × [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/))

## Beliefs
- Nothing beats [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) because nothing can beat [maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra)
- [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) × [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) × [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) are game changers
