# Meetup

PuffinDB will hold a kickoff meetup for [sponsors](../SPONSORS.md) and [contributors](../CONTRIBUTORS.md) on March 29 to 31, 2023, at the [Grand Park Hotel](https://www.maistra.com/properties/grand-park-hotel-rovinj/#/) in Rovinj, Croatia. Participants pay for travels expenses, while PuffinDB offers accomodations free of charge. The goal of the event is to finalize the architecture for PuffinDB, including [Icecap](../docs/Icecap.md). And to have some fun along the way...

This meetup is open to corporate sponsors and potential investors as well.

This first gathering will set the benchmark for all future events.

## Logistics
- March 29-31 (two nights in Rovinj, with overnight in Zagreb on March 28).
- Participants should fly through [Franjo Tuđman Airport Zagreb](https://www.zagreb-airport.hr/en).
- Roundtrip transportation between Zagreb and Rovinj will be organized by PuffinDB.

## Accomodations
The [Grand Park Hotel Rovinj](https://www.maistra.com/properties/grand-park-hotel-rovinj/#/) is... nice.
