# Cloudless Architecture

PuffinDB is designed to take advantage of emerging **cloudless architectures**:

**cloudless** *adjective*

1. Cloud deployment model whereby a cloud service is deployed by the service provider for a customer, using a customer-dedicated cloud account created and managed by the service provider.

2. Cloud deployment model whereby a cloud service is deployed by an organization for multiple teams, using team-dedicated cloud accounts created and managed by the organization.

## Benefits

- Easy onboarding without any cloud credentials
- Fully automated provisioning and maintenance
- Out-of-the-box integration of all required components and services
- Lower risk of service disruption due to incorrect configuration
- Downstream migration and consolidation

## Migration
Whenever PuffinDB is deployed in a cloudless manner, it can be migrated easily to a cloud account owned and operated by the customer.

## Consolidation
Multiple cloudless PuffinDB account can be consolidated easily into a single one.
