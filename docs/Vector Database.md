# Vector Database

PuffinDB is turning [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) into a full-blown vector database by adding support for the [Lance](https://github.com/eto-ai/lance) file format and by facilitating the acceleration of [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) on GPU, while storing very large vectors on data lakes such as [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/), and [Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/)
