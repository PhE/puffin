# DuckDB

PuffinDB is based on the recognition that [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is much more than an OLAP database management system. It is also:

- A [pervasive client](Clientless.md)
- A [data integration vector](../EDDI.md)
- A [data typing system](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/overview)
- A [SQL dialect](Query%20Proxy.md#dialect-translation)
- A [SQL parser](https://twitter.com/ghalimi/status/1625172235895046146)
- A [thriving community](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb)
- A growing ecosystem
- A change agent
