# Trustfull Analytics

TODO: Data Compliance related ?

To better understand the importance of Puffin Query Delegation we will go deeper in several use cases :

* [Yearly compliance reviews](#yearly-compliance-reviews)
* [Weekly commodity P&L positions](#weekly-commodity-pl-positions)
* [Weekly delta explainations](#weekly-delta-explainations)


What those cases have in common, beside the usual analytics features, is the high level of **trust** they require.
We can dream of a specialized query engine that can enforce compliance rules by :

* hashing/timestamping/signing any chunk of data passing thru it and by extend :
* signing data sources
* signing queries
* signing query results
* signing any source/query/result triplet
